Once upon a time,
on Halloween's Eve,
In a land of monsters,
witches, and make-believe,

In a haunted house,
old and grand,
Monsters and witches gathered, hand in hand.

That frightful night,
full of delight,
They decided it would be fun,
to sing, joke, and pun.
Instead of being scary and bad, they would be
frightfully mad.

The friendly, frightful crew
Now loved to spread glee
and laughter, too.

They sang and danced by the moonlight bright,
Making the Halloween night a cheerful sight.

There was a vampire,
tall and thin,
Who loved to
play his violin.

A mummy with bandages, all unraveled,
Told jokes that left everyone happily baffled.

A friendly grey bat,
flapping his wings,
Enjoyed the fun,
as everyone sings.

A friendly witch,
with a big black hat,
Brewed potions that made everyone chat.

And a sweet little ghost,
striped and round,
Giggled and floated,
fun he had found.

Grim took delight,
in not giving a fright,
But instead with a wave,
candies he gave.

The haunted house, once gloomy, cobwebbed,
and scary,
Was transformed to a pumpkin cottage,
by a Halloween fairy.

They invited children far and wide, for them to meet,
and bring trick-or-treat bags to fill with loot so sweet.

Together they celebrated, far from being scary,
A Halloween filled with joy,
oh so merry!

So in this story, you'll come to see
That even monsters and witches can be as friendly as can be.
